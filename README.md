Welcome to the Sneaker Collector App! [This app] (https://sneaker-collector-two.vercel.app/) allows you to collect and manage information about your favorite sneakers. Please note that the API endpoint provided for this app expires every 24 hours, so you may need to set up a new API endpoint if it stops working.

## Setting up API:

To get started, follow these steps to set up your own REST API instance:

Go to https://crudcrud.com/.
Create your own instance by clicking on the "New Project" button.
Once you have created the instance, you will be assigned a unique API endpoint URL. For example: https://crudcrud.com/api/02298cb371ca4cc29c8271f6710bdefe.
You can use this endpoint to send GET, POST, and DELETE requests with any structure you define, as long as you send data in JSON format.

## Sneaker Input Form:

In the app, there is a form where users can input sneaker details, including a title, brand, price, size, and year. The form includes validation to ensure that the inputs are not empty.

## Sneaker Collection:

The app displays a list of sneakers in a collection, showing the title and details for each sneaker. Each sneaker item in the collection includes a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove sneakers from the collection.

## Sneaker Sorting:

The app provides users with the option to sort sneakers in the collection by year, shoe size, or price. This feature makes it easy to organize and find sneakers based on different criteria.

## Query-like Interaction:

To enhance the user experience, the app includes a search feature. Users can use an input field to search for sneakers by their titles. As the user types in the search input, the displayed sneakers are dynamically updated to match the search query.
